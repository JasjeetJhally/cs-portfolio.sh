               Some of my favorite things: <br>
               My favorite food: <br>
               Fried chicken, because it tastes great, even though it isn't the best for your health. <br>
               My favorite movie: <br>
               Hard to say, but one of the most memorable is Unbroken. Unbroken is based off of the story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete turn WW2 Air Force Pilot and his journey of survival. His journey is truely inspiring and I highly recommend it.

                During my free time, I enjoy playing sports. Sports allow me to stay healthy, and give me a chance to improve my athletic abilites. I have been playing sports ever since I was 3 years old, and have not stopped. Besides playing sports, I like hanging out with friends. We play games, chat, and goof around.
