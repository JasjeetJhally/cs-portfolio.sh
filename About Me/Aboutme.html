<p id="hello">
               Hello, my name is <strong>Jasjeet Singh Jhally </strong>, and I am a sophomore at Summit Shasta. I live in South San Francisco, and have lived in the Bay Area for my entire life. So far, the places I have traveled to include Canada and Northern India, mainly for visiting relatives. In the future, I hope to get the opportunity to travel more.

               <strong>Favorite T.V Show:</strong> Too many to choose from, but right now I really enjoy watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I enjoy the concept behind it, that being a comedic twist on a police show, and the characters. Jake Peralta, played by Andy Samberg, is especially my favorite due to his overall hilarity. Sarge, played by Terry Crews, is also really great in the show. I only recently discovered the show, and have been loving it since.</p>

<p id="food">
<strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Again, so many to choose from, but I need to go with burger and fries. Although pretty generic and extremely unhealthy, this meal never fails to satisfy me. Plus, I was always shunned when wanting to eat this meal because it was so unhealthy, and eating makes it that much more better. </p>

            <p id="hobby">
                One of my favorite <strong>hobbies</strong> is playing sports. Some of my favorite sports to play are: basketball, soccer, tennis, football, field hockey, and running. Even though I may not be the most athletic or experienced, I still enjoy playing these sports as they are a great way to blow off stress and stay fit. I have played sports since I was in kindergarten, and have not stopped since.
